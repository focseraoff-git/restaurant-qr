## 🚀 1. Introduction & Getting Started

### System Overview
Focsera OS is built with a "Dark Glass" aesthetic, prioritizing visual clarity, speed, and ease of use. The system is divided into operational modules that communicate in real-time.

*   **Real-time Synced**: Orders placed at the counter or via QR appear instantly in the kitchen.
*   **Role-Based Access**: Specialized dashboards for different staff roles.
*   **Offline-First**: Resume operations smoothly even if connectivity is intermittent.

### Quick Start Guide

#### 1. Launching the System
Open the application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` or your deployed domain). You will be greeted by the **Role Selection Portal**.

#### 2. Select Your Module
*   **Counter OS**: Click here if you are taking orders or managing bills.
*   **Kitchen Monitor**: Click here to view incoming orders (Optimized for large TV/Tablet screens).
*   **Inventory**: Access stock levels, suppliers, and purchase orders.
*   **Staff**: Manage attendance and payroll.
*   **Billing**: View financial reports and expenses.

#### 3. Navigation
Once inside a module, use the **Glass Navigation Bar** (usually top or bottom) or Floating Action Buttons to navigate. The system uses a consistent layout:
*   **Top Bar**: Module Title & Status Indicators (e.g., "Live System", "Sync Active").
*   **Main Content**: Cards, Tables, or Dashboards.
*   **Action Buttons**: Brightly colored (Emerald/Blue/Amber) buttons for primary actions.
