# 👨‍🍳 Kitchen Admin OS - User Guide

The **Kitchen Admin OS (KDS)** provides chefs with a clear, real-time view of what needs to be cooked. It replaces traditional paper tickets with a digital display.

## 1. The Kitchen Display
This screen is designed to be displayed on a large monitor or tablet in the kitchen.
*   **Auto-Refresh**: The screen updates instantly when a new order is placed at the Counter or via QR code.
*   **Voice Alerts**: The system announces "New Order Received" (if audio is enabled).

## 2. Order Cards
Orders are displayed as cards, sorted by time (oldest first).
*   **Header**:
    *   **Order ID**: e.g., `#ORD-1234`
    *   **Timer**: Shows how long ago the order was placed (e.g., "5m ago").
    *   **Type**: Dine-In (with Table #) or Takeaway.
*   **Items List**:
    *   Clear list of items and quantities (e.g., `2x Butter Chicken`).
    *   **Special Instructions**: Any notes added by the waiter appear here.

## 3. Managing Workflow
Chefs interact with orders using simple status buttons:

1.  **Incoming (Pending)**: New orders appear here.
2.  **Start Preparation**:
    *   Click **👨‍🍳 Start Cooking**.
    *   Status changes to **Preparing** (Blue).
    *   Counter staff sees this update.
3.  **Mark Ready**:
    *   When food is plated, click **✅ Mark Ready**.
    *   Status changes to **Ready** (Green).
    *   Counter staff/Waiters are notified to pickup.

## 4. Item Availability
(If configured) Kitchen staff can toggle item availability if ingredients run out using the **"Stock Control"** mode (accessible via settings, if enabled).
